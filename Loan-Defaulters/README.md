**Project Overview**

For this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. 
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). 
As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back.

**Problem Statement**

To classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. 

**Evaluation metric**

For this particular dataset, we are using accuracy_score as the evaluation metric. 

Using Decision Tree Model ( accuracy_score = 0.839 )

Decision tree visualized using plot_tree library.
