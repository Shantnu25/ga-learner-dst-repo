## Forest Type Cover Prediction

The project revolves around the need to predict
the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree cover)
from strictly cartographic variables (as opposed to remotely sensed data). 

It includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.
These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances,
so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.

The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.
Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. You are asked to predict an integer classification for the forest cover type.
The seven types are:

Spruce/Fir

Lodgepole Pine

Ponderosa Pine

Cottonwood/Willow

Aspen

Douglas-fir

Krummholz

## Outcomes

In this project, I have used the following concepts:

    EDA & Data Preprocessing
    Feature Selection
    Model Building and hyperparameter tuning

After completing this project,
I have a better understanding of how to work on a dataset end to end
and the different strategies, which I can use to increase the evaluation metric. 

( I have used accuracy_score as the evaluation metric )
