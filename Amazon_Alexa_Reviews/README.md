## Amazon Alexa Reviews

I am working in the amazon company as data scientist.
They want you to focus on customer reviews on there alexa product.
So, our aim is to classify the unhappy customer based on the features 'rating', 'date', 'variation', 'verified_reviews', 'feedback'.
So let's work on the customer reviews.
