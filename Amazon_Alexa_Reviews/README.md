## Amazon Alexa Reviews

I am working in the amazon company as data scientist.
They want me to focus on customer reviews on there alexa product.
So, my aim is to classify the unhappy customer based on the features 'rating', 'date', 'variation', 'verified_reviews', 'feedback'.
So let's work on the customer reviews.

### About the Dataset:

The dataset has the following 5 features

Feature 	       -     Description

rating(target)   -   Product ratings(1/2/3/4/5)

variation 	     -   Product type

verified_reviews -	reviews given by customer

feedback 	       -  feedback given by customer(0/1)
